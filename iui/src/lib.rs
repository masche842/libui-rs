//! `iui`, the `i`mproved `u`ser `i`nterface crate, provides Rust bindings to `libui`, a wrapper library for native(ish) GUI libraries:
//!
//! - Win32API on Windows
//! - Cocoa on Mac OS X
//! - GTK+ on Linux and elsewhere
//!
//! This library exposes a Rusty procedural interface to the
//! "Least Common Denominator" of GUI widgets. They are all available on all supported platforms, though some functionality may not
//! perform precisely the same on all platforms. These inconsistencies are marked.
//!
//! To use the library, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
//! 
//! ```toml
//! "iui" = "0.2"
//! ```
//!
//! Most of the functionality of the crate is exposed via the [UI](struct.UI.html) RAII guard, which handles all initialization and cleanup for the
//! underlying library.
//! 
//! After initialization, all the functionality used for creating actual UIs is in the [`controls`](controls/index.html) module. 
//! 
//! Fine-grained control of the event loop is avilable via the [`EventLoop`](struct.EventLoop.html) struct.
//! Be aware the Cocoa (GUI toolkit on Mac OS) requires that the _first thread spawned_ controls
//! the UI, so do _not_ spin off your UI interactions into an alternative thread. You're likely to
//! have problems on Mac OS.
//!
//! For code examples, see the [basic](https://github.com/LeoTindall/libui-rs/blob/master/iui/examples/basic.rs) and
//! [advanced](https://github.com/LeoTindall/libui-rs/blob/master/iui/examples/inputs.rs) examples or the
//! [file editing](https://github.com/LeoTindall/libui-rs/blob/master/iui/examples/files.rs) example.
